### Overall Theme & Aesthetic:
-   **Futuristic Electrical Theme:** The dashboard clearly aims for a high-tech, electrical, and futuristic look. This is conveyed through:
    -   **Dark Background:** Predominantly dark, likely black or very dark blue/grey, with glowing accents.
    -   **Neon/Luminous Accents:** Bright, glowing lines and shapes, possibly in blue, purple, or cyan, suggesting energy flow or circuit boards.
    -   **Geometric Patterns:** Subtle geometric or circuit-like patterns in the background.
    -   **Clean, Modern Typography:** Sans-serif fonts, possibly with a slightly condensed or technical feel.
    -   **Minimalist Icons:** Simple, sharp icons that fit the tech aesthetic.

### Layout Breakdown:
The layout is complex and appears to be divided into several distinct sections:
1.  **Top Header/Filter Bar:** Contains main filters (TAHUN, BULAN) and possibly overall KPIs (TOTAL HAR, TOTAL GI/GITET, TOTAL ULTG).
2.  **Left Sidebar/Panel:** Contains filters (STATUS, LOKASI GI/GIS/GITET) and possibly a list of items with progress bars or indicators.
3.  **Main Content Area (Top):** Appears to have several smaller KPI cards or summary boxes (ANOMALI, GANTI MTU, RUTIN, NON RUTIN) and two pie/donut charts.
4.  **Main Content Area (Middle):** A large, complex bar chart or histogram, possibly showing distribution across various locations or types.
5.  **Main Content Area (Right):** A vertical list of items with associated bar charts or progress indicators, possibly showing distribution by equipment type (IBT, TRAFO, PMT, PMS, LA, CT, BAY).

### Specific Components & Visualizations:
-   **KPI Cards:** Small, distinct cards with numbers and labels, possibly with a subtle glow effect.
-   **Pie/Donut Charts:** Two prominent pie/donut charts, one showing 'ANOMALI' distribution and another for 'RUTIN' vs 'NON RUTIN'. These have clear labels and percentages.
-   **Bar Charts (Horizontal):**
    -   A large horizontal bar chart in the middle, with multiple colored bars per category, suggesting a stacked or grouped bar chart. This seems to represent different statuses (ANOMALI, GANTI MTU, NON RUTIN, RUTIN) across various 'LOKASI GI / GIS / GITET' or 'BAY / PHT' (based on the x-axis labels).
    -   Smaller horizontal bar charts on the right, associated with equipment types, showing quantities.
-   **Filter Elements:** Dropdown-like elements for TAHUN, BULAN, STATUS, LOKASI GI/GIS/GITET. These need to match the futuristic theme.
-   **Interactive Elements:** The presence of various charts and filters implies high interactivity, with updates across the dashboard based on filter selections.

### Data Mapping Considerations (Re-evaluation based on new design):
-   The new design emphasizes `ANOMALI`, `GANTI MTU`, `RUTIN`, `NON RUTIN` as key categories, which aligns with the `SIFAT PEKERJAAN` column in the Excel file and the `drop list` sheet (which contains these values).
-   The `LOKASI GI / GIS / GITET` and `BAY / PHT` columns from the Excel are clearly used for the large central bar chart and the right-side lists.
-   The `STATUS` column (SELESAI, BELUM SELESAI) is used for the pie chart and potentially other indicators.
-   The `TAHUN` and `BULAN` filters are explicitly shown.

### Challenges & Next Steps:
-   **Complex CSS/Styling:** Achieving the futuristic electrical look will require significant custom CSS, potentially using gradients, shadows, and pseudo-elements for glowing effects.
-   **Advanced Charting:** The charts are more complex than basic Chart.js defaults and might require custom Chart.js plugins or a more advanced charting library if Chart.js cannot achieve the desired look easily.
-   **Dynamic Filtering:** Ensuring all charts and KPIs update dynamically and efficiently with multiple filters will be crucial.
-   **Data Aggregation:** The backend will need to provide aggregated data in the specific formats required by these new chart types (e.g., counts per status per location, counts per equipment type).

This detailed analysis will guide the redesign of the frontend and any necessary adjustments to the backend data processing.

### Specific Components & Visualizations:

-   **Pie/Donut Charts:** Two prominent pie/donut charts, one showing \'ANOMALI\' distribution and another for \'RUTIN\' vs \'NON RUTIN\'. These have clear labels and percentages.

    -   A large horizontal bar chart in the middle, with multiple colored bars per category, suggesting a stacked or grouped bar chart.
